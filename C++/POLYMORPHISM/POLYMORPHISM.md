Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the concept of allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables a single interface to be used to represent different underlying forms (data types).

### Explanation:

- **Polymorphism**: The term "polymorphism" comes from the Greek words "poly" (meaning "many") and "morph" (meaning "form"). In the context of OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. This is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

### Types of Polymorphism:

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**:
   - Achieved through function overloading and operator overloading.
   - The decision of which method to call is made at compile time.

2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**:
   - Achieved through method overriding.
   - The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the object type.

### Example of Polymorphism in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "Some generic animal sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Bark" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Meow" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animal1 = new Dog();
    Animal* animal2 = new Cat();

    animal1->sound(); // Output: Bark
    animal2->sound(); // Output: Meow

    delete animal1;
    delete animal2;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Example:

- **Base Class `Animal`**: Contains a virtual function `sound()`.
- **Derived Classes `Dog` and `Cat`**: Override the `sound()` method to provide specific implementations.
- **Polymorphism in Action**: In the `main` function, pointers of type `Animal*` are used to point to objects of derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`. When the `sound()` method is called, the appropriate overridden method is executed based on the actual object type at runtime.

### Summary:

- **Polymorphism**: The concept of allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables a single interface to be used to represent different underlying forms (data types).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

a) Concept of allowing overriding of functions

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows for flexible and extensible code by enabling objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface.
