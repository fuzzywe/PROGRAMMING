The correct answer is:

**c) Ad-hoc polymorphism**

**Explanation:**
- **Ad-hoc polymorphism** refers to the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types or numbers (also known as **function overloading**). This allows a function to be called in different ways depending on the arguments passed to it.
- Ad-hoc polymorphism is resolved at **compile time**.

### Example of Function Overloading (Ad-hoc polymorphism):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print(int i) {
    cout << "Integer: " << i << endl;
}

void print(double d) {
    cout << "Double: " << d << endl;
}

void print(string s) {
    cout << "String: " << s << endl;
}

int main() {
    print(5);        // Calls the integer version
    print(3.14);     // Calls the double version
    print("Hello");  // Calls the string version
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `print()` function is overloaded to handle different data types, which is a form of ad-hoc polymorphism.

### **Potential Interview Questions and Answers**

#### **Q1. What is function overloading in C++?**
**Answer:**
- Function overloading is a feature in C++ where multiple functions with the same name are defined, but with different parameter types or numbers. The compiler distinguishes between them based on the number or type of arguments passed. This is a form of **ad-hoc polymorphism**.

#### **Q2. How is function overloading different from overriding?**
**Answer:**
- **Function overloading** occurs at compile time and allows multiple functions with the same name but different signatures.
- **Function overriding** occurs at runtime when a derived class provides a specific implementation of a function that is already defined in its base class, often using virtual functions.

#### **Q3. Can overloaded functions have the same number of parameters?**
**Answer:**
- Yes, overloaded functions can have the same number of parameters, but the parameters must differ in their **types**. The compiler distinguishes between the functions based on the type of arguments passed.

#### **Q4. What is ad-hoc polymorphism?**
**Answer:**
- **Ad-hoc polymorphism** is the ability to define functions or operators that work with different types of data. In C++, ad-hoc polymorphism is implemented through **function overloading** and **operator overloading**.

#### **Q5. Give an example of operator overloading as ad-hoc polymorphism.**
**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
    int real, imag;
public:
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    Complex operator + (const Complex& c) {
        return Complex(real + c.real, imag + c.imag);
    }

    void display() {
        cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(3, 4), c2(1, 2);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // Overloaded '+' operator
    c3.display();  // Output: 4 + 6i
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `+` operator is overloaded to work with complex numbers, which is an example of ad-hoc polymorphism.

#### **Q6. Why is function overloading considered compile-time polymorphism?**
**Answer:**
- Function overloading is considered **compile-time polymorphism** because the compiler determines which version of the overloaded function to call based on the arguments passed. The decision is made during compilation, rather than at runtime.

#### **Q7. Can function overloading be used with default arguments?**
**Answer:**
- Yes, function overloading can be used with default arguments, but care must be taken to ensure that the function calls remain unambiguous. If multiple overloaded functions have default arguments, it can lead to ambiguity in resolving function calls.

#### **Q8. What are the limitations of function overloading in C++?**
**Answer:**
- Function overloading cannot distinguish between functions based on return types alone. The function signatures must differ in their parameters, either by type or number of arguments.

#### **Q9. Can you overload functions with variable-length argument lists in C++?**
**Answer:**
- C++ supports variable-length argument lists using `...` (ellipsis), but function overloading with variable-length arguments can lead to ambiguity. It's better to use well-defined function signatures to avoid confusion and errors.

#### **Q10. How does the compiler resolve overloaded functions?**
**Answer:**
- The compiler resolves overloaded functions by matching the function call to the function definition based on the **number** and **types** of arguments provided. If there is no exact match, the compiler attempts to perform type promotion or conversion, if possible, to match a valid function.

These interview questions and answers will help clarify the concept of function overloading and its relationship to ad-hoc polymorphism in C++.

### Which of the following explains the overloading of functions?
**Answer: c) Ad-hoc polymorphism**

Ad-hoc polymorphism refers to the ability to use the same function name for different types or different numbers of arguments. This is also known as function overloading. In function overloading, multiple functions can have the same name but differ in the type or number of their parameters.

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is function overloading?**
   - **Answer:** Function overloading is a feature in programming that allows multiple functions to have the same name but different parameters. The function to be called is determined by the number, type, and order of the arguments passed to the function.

2. **Can you give an example of function overloading in C++?**
   - **Answer:** Sure, here is an example of function overloading in C++:
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     void print(int i) {
         cout << "Printing int: " << i << endl;
     }

     void print(double f) {
         cout << "Printing float: " << f << endl;
     }

     void print(string s) {
         cout << "Printing string: " << s << endl;
     }

     int main() {
         print(10);
         print(10.5);
         print("Hello, World!");
         return 0;
     }
     ```
     In this example, the `print` function is overloaded to handle different types of arguments: `int`, `double`, and `string`.

3. **What is the difference between function overloading and function overriding?**
   - **Answer:** Function overloading occurs when multiple functions have the same name but different parameters within the same scope. Function overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. Overriding is a form of runtime polymorphism, while overloading is a form of compile-time polymorphism.

4. **What are the benefits of function overloading?**
   - **Answer:** The benefits of function overloading include improved code readability and maintainability. It allows developers to use the same function name for different but related operations, making the code more intuitive and easier to understand. Additionally, it reduces the need for creating multiple function names for similar operations.

5. **Can function overloading be used in languages other than C++?**
   - **Answer:** Yes, function overloading is supported in several programming languages, including Java, C#, and Python (through different mechanisms like default arguments and variable-length argument lists). The concept of function overloading is not unique to C++ and is a common feature in many object-oriented programming languages.

These questions and answers should help you understand the concept of function overloading and its importance in software development.
