### **1. What is C++? How is it different from C?**
- **C++** is a general-purpose programming language that supports object-oriented programming (OOP), procedural programming, and generic programming.
- **Differences from C**:
  - C++ supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, while C is procedural.
  - C++ has features like function overloading, operator overloading, and references, which are absent in C.
  - C++ provides better memory management with `new` and `delete` compared to `malloc()` and `free()` in C.

---

### **2. Explain the features of C++**
- **OOP Support**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Platform Independence**: Write once, compile anywhere.

- **Exception Handling**: `try`, `catch`, and `throw` for error handling.
- **Templates**: Supports generic programming.

---

### **3. What is the difference between `struct` and `class` in C++?**
- **Default Access Specifier**:
  - In `struct`, members are `public` by default.

- **Usage**:
  - `struct` is typically used for plain data structures.
  - `class` is used for OOP with encapsulation and inheritance.

---

### **4. What is the difference between `malloc()` and `new`?**
- **`malloc()`**:
  - C library function.
  - Allocates raw memory without calling constructors.
  - Returns `void*`, requiring explicit typecasting.
- **`new`**:
  - C++ operator.
  - Allocates memory and calls the constructor for object initialization.
  - Returns a pointer of the correct type.
  - Can be overloaded for custom memory management.

---

### **5. What is the difference between `delete` and `free()`?**
- **`delete`**:
  - C++ operator.

---

### **8. What is the difference between `++i` and `i++`?**
- **`++i` (Pre-increment)**:
  - Increments the value of `i` before using it.
  - More efficient as it does not create a temporary object.
- **`i++` (Post-increment)**:
  - Increments the value of `i` after using it.
  - Less efficient as it creates a temporary object.

---

### **9. What is a namespace in C++? Why is it used?**
- A **namespace** is a declarative region that provides a scope for identifiers (variables, functions, classes, etc.).
- **Purpose**:
  - Avoid naming conflicts.
  - Organize code into logical groups.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  namespace MyNamespace {
      int x = 10;
  }
  ```

---

---

Here are the **answers to the next 20 C++ interview questions** with unique and detailed explanations to help you stand out in your interview:

---

### **21. What is dynamic memory allocation in C++?**
- **Dynamic memory allocation** allows programs to allocate memory at runtime instead of compile time.
- In C++, this is done using `new` and `delete` operators.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  int* ptr = new int; // Allocate memory for an integer
  *ptr = 10;          // Assign value
  delete ptr;         // Free memory
  ```

---

### **22. What is the difference between stack and heap memory?**
- **Stack Memory**:
  - Used for static memory allocation.
  - Memory is managed automatically (LIFO order).
  - Faster access but limited in size.
  - Stores local variables and function calls.
- **Heap Memory**:
  - Used for dynamic memory allocation.
  - Memory is managed manually using `new` and `delete`.
  - Slower access but larger in size.
  - Stores objects and data structures with dynamic lifetimes.

---

### **23. What is a memory leak? How can it be avoided?**
- **Memory Leak**:
  - Occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not deallocated, causing memory to be wasted.
- **Avoidance**:
  - Always use `delete` or `delete[]` to free memory allocated with `new`.
  - Use smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`) for automatic memory management.
  - Tools like Valgrind can help detect memory leaks.

---

### **24. What is a smart pointer? Explain `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and `weak_ptr`.**
- **Smart Pointers**:
  - Objects that manage the lifetime of dynamically allocated memory.
- **`unique_ptr`**:
  - Owns the memory exclusively.
  - Cannot be copied, only moved.
- **`shared_ptr`**:
  - Allows multiple pointers to share ownership of the same memory.
  - Uses reference counting to manage memory.
- **`weak_ptr`**:
  - A non-owning pointer that references a `shared_ptr`.
  - Prevents cyclic dependencies.

---

### **25. What is RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)?**
- **RAII**:
  - A programming idiom where resource management is tied to object lifetime.
  - Resources (e.g., memory, file handles) are acquired during object construction and released during destruction.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  class File {
      FILE* file;
  public:
      File(const char* filename) : file(fopen(filename, "r")) {}
      ~File() { if (file) fclose(file); }
  };
  ```

---

### **26. How does `new` handle memory allocation failures?**
- If `new` fails to allocate memory, it throws a `std::bad_alloc` exception.
- To handle failures:
  ```cpp
  try {
      int* ptr = new int[1000000000000];
  } catch (std::bad_alloc& e) {
      std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
  ```

---

### **27. What is the difference between `delete` and `delete[]`?**
- **`delete`**:
  - Used to deallocate memory for a single object allocated with `new`.
- **`delete[]`**:
  - Used to deallocate memory for an array of objects allocated with `new[]`.

---

### **28. What is a dangling pointer? How can it be avoided?**
- **Dangling Pointer**:
  - A pointer that points to a memory location that has already been deallocated.
- **Avoidance**:
  - Set pointers to `nullptr` after deallocating memory.
  - Use smart pointers to manage memory automatically.

---

### **29. What is a memory pool in C++?**
- **Memory Pool**:
  - A pre-allocated block of memory used for efficient memory management.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces fragmentation and allocation overhead.
  - Improves performance for frequent allocations and deallocations.

---

### **30. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?**
- **Shallow Copy**:
  - Copies the memory address of the object, not the actual data.
  - Both objects share the same memory.
- **Deep Copy**:
  - Copies the actual data, creating a new memory block.
  - Objects have independent memory.

---

### **31. What are templates in C++? Explain function templates and class templates.**
- **Templates**:
  - Allow writing generic and reusable code.
- **Function Templates**:
  - Define a function that works with any data type.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    template <typename T>
    T add(T a, T b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    ```
- **Class Templates**:
  - Define a class that works with any data type.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    template <typename T>
    class Box {
        T value;
    public:
        void set(T v) { value = v; }
        T get() { return value; }
    };
    ```
