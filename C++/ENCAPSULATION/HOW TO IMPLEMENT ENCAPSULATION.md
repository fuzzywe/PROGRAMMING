ðŸ“ŒEncapsulation can be  implemented using  "getters()" and "setters()"  .
ðŸ“ŒAnd by declaring variables as "Private".
Getter methods provide controlled access to the private fields. They return the value of the field.
Setter methods provide controlled modification of the private fields. They take a parameter and assign it to the corresponding field.

You're absolutely right! Encapsulation is primarily achieved through private variables and public getter and setter methods. This approach ensures data integrity and controlled access to the object's state.
Helper methods are private methods within a class that assist in the implementation of public methods. They can be used to encapsulate complex logic, reduce code redundancy, and improve code readability.
