Let’s break down how much **memory** a **character (`char`)** and a **character literal** hold:

### 1. **Character (`char`)**:
- A **character** (`char`) is a **data type** that takes up **1 byte** of memory in C and C++.
- In terms of storage, **1 byte** equals **8 bits**, which means it can represent **256 different values** (from 0 to 255).
- Each character (like `'A'`, `'B'`, etc.) is stored using a **number** called its **ASCII value**.

#### Example:
- The character `'A'` has an **ASCII value** of **65**, and this value is stored in the `char` variable.
- The character `'B'` has an **ASCII value** of **66**.

So, if you declare a `char` variable like this:
```cpp
char letter = 'A';
```
- The **`letter`** variable stores the value **65** (because the ASCII value of `'A'` is 65).
- This value takes up **1 byte** of memory.

### 2. **Character Literal**:
- A **character literal** is the **representation** of the character in your code, written between single quotes (e.g., `'A'`, `'B'`).
- When you use a **character literal** like `'A'` in your code, it is immediately converted into the **ASCII value** of that character.
- This ASCII value (e.g., **65** for `'A'`) is what gets stored in the **1 byte** of the `char` variable.

### How Much Memory Does It Hold:
- **Both** the `char` variable and the **character literal** hold **1 byte** of memory, as the character literal is just a way to tell the computer which **ASCII value** to store.
  
### Summary:
- **Character (`char`)**: Holds **1 byte** of memory (8 bits).
  - Example: `char letter = 'A';` stores the ASCII value **65** (for `'A'`), and it takes up 1 byte.
  
- **Character Literal**: Also results in **1 byte** of storage since it’s just a **symbol** in the code that gets converted to an ASCII value.
  - Example: `'A'` in the code is the symbol, but it represents **65**, and it takes up 1 byte when stored in a `char`.

Both are connected, but the literal is what you write in the code, and the `char` variable is where the **1-byte** value (ASCII) is stored in memory.

### **Memory Breakdown**:

| **Character**         | **ASCII Value** | **Memory (Bytes)** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| `'A'`                 | 65              | 1 byte (8 bits)    |
| `'B'`                 | 66              | 1 byte (8 bits)    |
| `'1'`                 | 49              | 1 byte (8 bits)    |
| `'#'`                 | 35              | 1 byte (8 bits)    |

Each character literal has an **ASCII value** that takes up exactly **1 byte** when stored in a `char`.
