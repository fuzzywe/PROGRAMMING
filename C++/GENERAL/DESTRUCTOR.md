why is the Destructor Private?

Making a destructor private is a way to control how objects of the class are created and destroyed.
If the destructor is private, it prevents the creation of normal objects of that class. This is useful when you want to manage the lifecycle of objects more strictly, often using pointers instead.
What Happens in the main Function?

In the main function, we try to create an object A a;.
When the program ends, it tries to destroy the object a, which means it will call the destructor ~A().
However, since the destructor is private, the program cannot access it, leading to a compile-time error.
Why Does It Result in an Error?

The compiler checks the code before running it. When it sees that it needs to call a private destructor for a normal object, it raises an error.
If we had used a pointer to an object of class A, like A* a = new A;, the compiler would not know about the destructor at compile time, and it would not raise an error.
Summary of Options:

a) Destructor called: This would happen if the destructor were public, but it is not.
b) Nothing will be printed: This is incorrect because the program will not compile.
c) Error: This is the correct answer because of the private destructor.
d) Segmentation fault: This is a runtime error that does not apply here since the error occurs at compile time.

Explanation: Whenever a destructor is private then one should not define any normal object as it will be destroyed at the end of the program which will call destructor and as destructor is private the program gives error during compile while in case of pointer object the compiler at compile does not know about the object, therefore, does not gives compile error. Hence when the destructor is private then the programmer can declare pointer object but cannot declare a normal object.
In conclusion, the key takeaway is that when a destructor is private, you cannot create normal objects of that class, leading to a compile-time error. Understanding destructors and their access levels is crucial for managing resources in C++.
