The difference between delete and delete[] in C++ relates to how memory is deallocated when it was allocated using new or new[]:

delete: This is used to deallocate memory that was allocated for a single object using new.
delete[]: This is used to deallocate memory that was allocated for an array of objects using new[].
Key Differences:
delete: Should be used for single object deletion.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
int* ptr = new int;  // Allocate memory for a single integer
delete ptr;  // Correct: uses delete for a single object
delete[]: Should be used when deleting an array of objects.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
int* arr = new int[5];  // Allocate memory for an array of 5 integers
delete[] arr;  // Correct: uses delete[] for an array
