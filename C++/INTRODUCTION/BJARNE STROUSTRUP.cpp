Who is Bjarne Stroustrup?
Bjarne Stroustrup is a famous computer scientist from Denmark.
  He is best known for creating the C++ programming language. C++ is a powerful language used to write
software for computers, games, and many other applications. Think of him as a chef who invented a new
  recipe that many people now use to cook delicious meals.

What did he do?
Stroustrup started working on C++ in the late 1970s while he was at Bell Labs, 
  a research facility in the United States. He wanted to improve the C programming language, 
which was already popular. C was like a basic tool for building things, and Stroustrup wanted to add more
features to make it easier to use and more powerful. Imagine upgrading a simple toolbox to include 
more advanced tools for a builder.

Why is C++ important?
C++ is important because it allows programmers to write complex software more easily. 
  It combines features from both C and object-oriented programming. Object-oriented programming is a 
way of organizing code that makes it easier to manage and reuse. Think of it like organizing your room: 
when everything is in its place, it’s easier to find what you need.

What are some features of C++?
C++ has several key features:

Classes and Objects: These are like blueprints and the actual buildings made from those blueprints.
  Classes define the structure, while objects are the real instances created from those classes.
Inheritance: This allows one class to inherit properties from another, similar to how children 
inherit traits from their parents.
Polymorphism: This means that one function can work in different ways depending on the context, 
  like how a person can be a teacher, a friend, or a parent depending on the situation.
Impact on the world:
Stroustrup's work has had a huge impact on technology. Many software applications, games, 
  and systems we use today are built using C++. His contributions have helped shape the way 
we think about programming and software development. It’s like how a great artist influences 
other artists with their unique style.

Legacy:
Bjarne Stroustrup continues to be active in the field of computer science. He writes books
and gives talks about programming and software design. His ideas and innovations inspire new generations
  of programmers. Just like a great teacher who inspires students to learn and create, Stroustrup encourages
others to explore the world of coding.

In summary, Bjarne Stroustrup is a key figure in computer science, known for creating C++. 
  His work has changed how we write software, making it easier and more efficient.
