Let's analyze the given code step by step to understand what it does and what the output will be.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void square(int *x, int *y) {
    *x = (*x) * --(*y);
}

int main() {
    int number = 30;
    square(&number, &number);
    cout << number;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `square` function takes two pointers to integers (`int *x` and `int *y`).
   - Inside the function, the expression `*x = (*x) * --(*y);` is executed.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `--(*y)`: This is a pre-decrement operation. It decrements the value pointed to by `y` by 1 before using it.
   - `(*x) * --(*y)`: This multiplies the value pointed to by `x` with the decremented value pointed to by `y`.
   - `*x = (*x) * --(*y)`: This assigns the result of the multiplication back to the value pointed to by `x`.

3. **Main Function**:
   - `int number = 30;`: Initializes the variable `number` to 30.
   - `square(&number, &number);`: Calls the `square` function, passing the address of `number` for both parameters.
   - `cout << number;`: Prints the value of `number` after the function call.

### Detailed Execution:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `number = 30`

2. **Function Call**:
   - `square(&number, &number);`
   - Both `x` and `y` point to the same variable `number`.

3. **Expression Execution**:
   - `--(*y)`: Decrements the value of `number` by 1. So, `number` becomes 29.
   - `(*x) * --(*y)`: Multiplies the current value of `number` (30) by the decremented value of `number` (29).
   - `*x = (*x) * --(*y)`: Assigns the result (30 * 29 = 870) back to `number`.

### Final Output:

After the function call, the value of `number` is 870.

```cpp
cout << number; // Output: 870
```

### Summary:

- The `square` function modifies the value of `number` by decrementing it and then multiplying the original value by the decremented value.
- The final value of `number` after the function call is 870.
- The output of the program is `870`.

This code demonstrates the use of pointers and the pre-decrement operator in C++. It also shows how passing the same variable to multiple parameters can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.
