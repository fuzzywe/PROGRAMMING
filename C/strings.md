Youâ€™re absolutely correct! In C, `string` is not a built-in type, and the expression `string p = "HELLO";` requires a user-defined type alias using `typedef`. Here's a detailed explanation to complement your understanding:

---

### Why `typedef` is Needed for `string`
C does not provide a built-in `string` type like other languages such as Python or Java. In C, strings are represented as:
- **Arrays of characters (`char[]`)**: A collection of characters stored sequentially in memory, terminated by a null character `\0`.
- **Pointers to characters (`char *`)**: A pointer to the memory address of the first character in a string literal or dynamically allocated memory.

To create an alias `string` that represents the way strings are handled in C, we use `typedef`.

### What Happens in `string p = "HELLO";`

1. **`"HELLO"` as a String Literal:**
   - The string literal `"HELLO"` is stored as a constant in memory. 
   - It decays to a `char *`, a pointer to the first character (`H`) in the string.

2. **`string` as `typedef char *`:**
   - When `typedef char *string;` is defined, `string` becomes an alias for `char *`.
   - The statement `string p = "HELLO";` is valid because `"HELLO"` decays to a `char *`, and `p` is declared as a `char *`.

3. **`typedef char [] string;` Does Not Work:**
   - Defining `string` as `typedef char []` would fail because arrays are not assignable in C. For example:
     ```c
     typedef char [] string;
     string p = "HELLO"; // ERROR: Arrays cannot be assigned directly.
     ```

4. **Why `typedef char *string;` Works:**
   - A `char *` can store the address of a string literal, which is why `typedef char *string;` makes the expression valid.

---

### Practical Code Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
typedef char *string; // Alias string for char *

int main() {
    string p = "HELLO"; // Equivalent to char *p = "HELLO";
    printf("%s\n", p);  // Prints: HELLO
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Summary

- **Key Reasoning**: The expression `string p = "HELLO";` is valid if `string` is defined as `typedef char *string;`.
- **Purpose of `typedef`**: It provides a shorthand for commonly used types, improving code readability and reducing complexity.
