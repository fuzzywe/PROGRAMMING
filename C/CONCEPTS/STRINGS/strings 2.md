In C, the `string` keyword is not used because C does not have a built-in `string` data type like higher-level languages such as Python, Java, or C++. Instead, C handles strings using **character arrays** (`char[]`) and **pointers (`char*`)**.

### Reasons Why `string` Keyword is Not Used in C:
1. **C is a Low-Level Language:**  
   - C is closer to assembly and does not have high-level abstractions like a `string` type.
   - Instead, it provides character arrays and pointer arithmetic to manage strings manually.

2. **Null-Terminated Character Arrays:**  
   - Strings in C are represented as an array of characters ending with a **null character (`\0`)**.
   - Example:
     ```c
     char str[] = "Hello";
     ```
     Internally, it is stored as:
     ```
     ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0']
     ```

3. **Memory Management:**  
   - Since C does not have automatic memory management (like garbage collection), it allows **manual control** over memory allocation for strings using `malloc()` and `free()`.
   - Example:
     ```c
     char *str = (char *)malloc(20 * sizeof(char));  // Allocate memory
     strcpy(str, "Hello, World!");  // Copy a string
     free(str);  // Free allocated memory
     ```

4. **No Standard `string` Type in C Library:**  
   - The C Standard Library provides the `<string.h>` header with functions like `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, and `strcmp()` to manipulate character arrays instead of a dedicated `string` type.

5. **C++ Introduced `string` as an Object-Oriented Abstraction:**  
   - In C++, the `string` class is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and provides high-level operations:
     ```cpp
     #include <string>
     std::string s = "Hello";
     ```

### Conclusion:
C does not have a `string` keyword because it provides direct access to memory using **character arrays** and **pointers**. The lack of a built-in `string` type keeps C **lightweight and efficient**, making it suitable for **low-level system programming**. If you need an object-oriented string, you can use **C++ instead of C**.



Let me explain it in a simpler way.  

In C, there is no **`string`** keyword because C does not have a built-in **string data type**. Instead, C represents strings using **character arrays (`char[]`)** and **pointers (`char*`)**.  

### Why does C not have a `string` keyword?  

1. **C treats strings as arrays of characters**  
   - In C, a string is just a sequence of characters stored in an array, ending with a special character `\0` (null character).  
   - Example:  
     ```c
     char name[] = "Hello";
     ```
     Internally, it is stored like this:  
     ```
     ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0']
     ```
     C does not have a separate **`string`** type because it already manages text using `char[]`.

2. **C does not have built-in memory management for strings**  
   - In languages like **C++ (std::string)** or **Python (`str`)**, strings are objects that manage their own memory.  
   - In C, you must manually allocate and free memory when working with strings:
     ```c
     char *str = (char *)malloc(20 * sizeof(char));  // Allocate memory
     strcpy(str, "Hello, World!");  // Copy text into allocated memory
     free(str);  // Free memory
     ```

3. **C uses `<string.h>` functions to work with strings**  
   - Since there is no `string` type, C provides functions in `<string.h>` like `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, and `strcmp()` to handle string operations.

### How is this different from C++?  
In C++, you can use the `std::string` type, which is **easier to use** than character arrays:  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name = "Hello";
    cout << name;
}
```
But in C, you **must use `char[]` or `char*` instead** because `string` does not exist.  

### Summary  
- **C does not have `string` because it handles text using `char[]` (character arrays).**  
- **C requires manual memory management for strings, unlike C++ or Python.**  
- **To work with strings, C provides functions like `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, etc. from `<string.h>`.**
