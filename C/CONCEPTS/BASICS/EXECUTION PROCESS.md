### **Interview Questions and Answers Related to C Language**

1. **What makes C a high-level programming language?**
   - **Answer**: C is a high-level language because it abstracts away low-level hardware details and uses human-readable syntax. This allows programmers to focus on writing functional code rather than managing hardware specifics.

2. **Why is C considered a "core language" in computer science?**
   - **Answer**: C is foundational for many programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. These languages borrow their structure, syntax, and features from C, making it crucial for understanding modern software development.

3. **Can you give an example where portability of C code is advantageous?**
   - **Answer**: Portability allows C programs to run across different operating systems like Windows, Linux, or macOS. For instance, software developed in C for one platform (e.g., a Linux server) can be compiled and run on another platform (e.g., a Windows-based server), reducing development time and cost.

4. **What are built-in functions in C and how do they make programming easier?**
   - **Answer**: Built-in functions in C are pre-written functions that perform common tasks, like `printf` for output or `malloc` for memory allocation. They simplify programming by reducing the need for developers to write repetitive code.

5. **How does C support modular programming?**
   - **Answer**: C supports modular programming by allowing developers to divide code into smaller, reusable functions. This improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces errors. For example, a program to calculate the area of different shapes can be divided into separate functions for each shape.

6. **Why is memory management important in C, and how does it work?**
   - **Answer**: Memory management in C is critical because it allows programs to dynamically allocate and free memory as needed. This is done using functions like `malloc` for allocation and `free` for deallocation. In embedded systems, where memory is limited, efficient memory usage is vital.

7. **What are pointers in C and how are they used in real-world applications?**
   - **Answer**: Pointers in C store memory addresses and allow direct manipulation of memory. They are essential for dynamic memory management, working with arrays, and optimizing performance in system programming. For example, in an operating system kernel, pointers are used to manage processes and memory.

8. **What is the difference between `malloc` and `calloc`?**
   - **Answer**: `malloc` allocates a block of memory of a specified size but does not initialize it, while `calloc` allocates memory for an array of elements and initializes all of them to zero.

9. **How is C used in embedded systems?**
   - **Answer**: C is widely used in embedded systems for hardware interaction due to its ability to access memory directly, its compact size, and its efficiency. For instance, a microcontroller used in a car’s engine control unit may run C programs to control various sensors and actuators.

10. **What does it mean that C is "platform dependent" when it comes to object files?**
   - **Answer**: An object file created on one platform (e.g., Windows) cannot be run on another platform (e.g., Linux) due to differences in file formats and operating system architecture. However, the source code written in C can be compiled on any platform.

11. **How does C support dynamic memory allocation during runtime?**
   - **Answer**: C provides functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` for dynamic memory allocation. These functions allow memory to be allocated during program execution based on the needs at runtime, making it adaptable to varying conditions.

12. **What is the role of built-in operators in C?**
