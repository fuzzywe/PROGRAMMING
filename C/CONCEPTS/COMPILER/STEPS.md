The correct answer is:

**a) assembly code**

### **Explanation:**

When you compile a C program (e.g., `sanfoundry.c`) using GCC with the `-S` flag, the compiler generates an **assembly code** file (e.g., `sanfoundry.s`). Here's how it works:

---

### **1. Compilation Process with GCC**
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) follows a multi-step process to convert C source code into an executable:
  1. **Preprocessing**: Expands macros, includes headers, and processes directives (e.g., `#include`, `#define`).
  2. **Compilation**: Translates the preprocessed C code into **assembly code**.
  3. **Assembly**: Converts the assembly code into **machine code** (object file).
  4. **Linking**: Combines object files and libraries into an **executable**.

---

### **2. Generating Assembly Code**
- To generate assembly code, you use the `-S` flag with GCC:
  ```bash
  gcc -S sanfoundry.c
  ```
  - This command stops the compilation process after the **compilation** step and outputs the assembly code to a file named `sanfoundry.s`.

---

### **3. What is in `sanfoundry.s`?**
- The `sanfoundry.s` file contains **assembly code**, which is a human-readable, low-level representation of the program.
- Assembly code is specific to the target architecture (e.g., x86, ARM) and consists of instructions like `mov`, `add`, `call`, etc.

---

### **4. Why Not the Other Options?**
- **b) machine code**: Machine code is generated during the **assembly** step and is stored in object files (e.g., `.o`), not in `.s` files.
- **c) preprocessed code**: Preprocessed code is generated during the **preprocessing** step and can be viewed using the `-E` flag with GCC.
- **d) expanded source code**: This is essentially the same as preprocessed code, which is not stored in `.s` files.

---

### **Example**
Consider the following C code (`sanfoundry.c`):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, Sanfoundry!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

When you compile it with:
```bash
gcc -S sanfoundry.c
```

The `sanfoundry.s` file will contain assembly code like this (for x86 architecture):
```assembly
    .section    __TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions
    .globl  _main
_main:
    pushq   %rbp
    movq    %rsp, %rbp
    leaq    L_.str(%rip), %rdi
    callq   _puts
    xorl    %eax, %eax
    popq    %rbp
    retq
    .section    __TEXT,__cstring,cstring_literals
L_.str:
    .asciz  "Hello, Sanfoundry!\n"
```

---

### **Key Takeaway**
The `sanfoundry.s` file contains **assembly code**, which is generated during the compilation step when using the `-S` flag with GCC. Thus, the correct answer is **a) assembly code**.
