A **segmentation fault** (often abbreviated as **segfault**) is a specific type of error that occurs when a program tries to **access a memory location that it's not allowed to access**. It typically results in the program being terminated by the operating system, and it is often caused by improper memory access in C and C++ programs.

### Causes of a Segmentation Fault:

1. **Accessing Invalid Memory Locations:**
   - This occurs when a program tries to access a part of memory that it is not allowed to, such as:
     - Dereferencing a **NULL** or **uninitialized pointer**.
     - Trying to access memory outside the bounds of an array or buffer.
     - Using a pointer after it has been **freed** (dangling pointer).

2. **Buffer Overflow:**
   - Writing data beyond the allocated size of an array or buffer can overwrite other critical memory areas, causing a segmentation fault.
   - For example, accessing an element beyond the size of a statically allocated array.

3. **Stack Overflow:**
   - When a function uses too much stack space, such as due to **deep recursion**, it can overflow the stack, leading to a segmentation fault.

4. **Invalid Pointer Arithmetic:**
   - Performing incorrect pointer arithmetic that leads to accessing memory locations that the program is not authorized to access can result in a segmentation fault.

5. **Dereferencing an Invalid Pointer:**
   - Dereferencing a pointer that does not point to a valid memory location (for example, pointing to an invalid address or using a null pointer) can cause a segmentation fault.

### Example of Causes:

1. **Dereferencing a NULL Pointer:**
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       int *p = NULL;  // p is a NULL pointer
       *p = 10;  // Dereferencing a NULL pointer causes a segmentation fault
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   - Here, `p` is a **NULL pointer**. When you attempt to dereference it (`*p = 10`), you are trying to write to memory that is not allocated, causing a segmentation fault.

2. **Accessing Out-of-Bounds Array Elements:**
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
       printf("%d\n", arr[10]);  // Accessing an element outside the bounds of the array
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   - The array `arr` has 5 elements (indexed from 0 to 4). Accessing `arr[10]` is out of bounds, which can result in a segmentation fault because the program is trying to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated array.

3. **Dereferencing a Freed Pointer:**
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   int main() {
       int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));  // Dynamically allocated memory
       *p = 10;  // Assign value to the allocated memory
       free(p);  // Free the allocated memory
       *p = 20;  // Dereferencing a freed pointer causes a segmentation fault
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   - After `p` is freed, it no longer points to valid memory. Dereferencing `p` after it has been freed causes a segmentation fault (dangling pointer).

### How to Debug a Segmentation Fault:

1. **Use a Debugger:**
   - A debugger such as **GDB** (GNU Debugger) can be used to locate where the segmentation fault occurs in your code. GDB allows you to step through the code and inspect the state of variables when the fault occurs.

   Example:
   ```bash
   gdb ./your_program
   run
   (When the segmentation fault occurs)
   backtrace
   ```

2. **Check for NULL Pointers:**
   - Always check if pointers are `NULL` before dereferencing them.

3. **Bounds Checking:**
   - Ensure that arrays or buffers are not accessed out of their bounds. This is often done using techniques like manually checking indices or using modern container classes (like `std::vector` in C++) that handle bounds checking.

4. **Memory Management Tools:**
   - Tools like **Valgrind** can help detect memory issues, such as accessing uninitialized memory or dereferencing freed pointers.

   Example:
   ```bash
   valgrind ./your_program
   ```

5. **Proper Memory Allocation:**
   - Always ensure that memory is properly allocated and freed. Avoid using memory after it has been freed, and always check the success of memory allocation (e.g., check if `malloc()` returned `NULL`).

---

### Summary:
A **segmentation fault** occurs when a program attempts to access memory that it is not allowed to, such as dereferencing a NULL pointer or accessing memory outside of an allocated region. It is a critical error in programs written in languages like C and C++, and is typically caused by incorrect memory access, buffer overflows, or invalid pointer operations. Debugging tools like GDB and Valgrind can help identify the source of the segmentation fault.
