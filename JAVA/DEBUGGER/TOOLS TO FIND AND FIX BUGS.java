Java: Uses JDB and IDEs like Eclipse for debugging, with logging frameworks for tracking program execution.
C: Relies on GDB for debugging, along with IDEs that support debugging features.
C++: Similar to C, GDB is commonly used, and IDEs provide integrated debugging.
Python: Utilizes PDB for interactive debugging and logging for runtime tracking.

Java:

JDB (Java Debugger): A command-line debugger included with the JDK.
IDE integration: Tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans offer powerful integrated debugging features.
Logging frameworks: Popular options include Log4j, SLF4J, and java.util.logging for runtime tracking.
Remote debugging: Allows debugging applications running on remote JVMs.
JConsole and VisualVM: For monitoring and troubleshooting JVM-related issues.


C:

GDB (GNU Debugger): The standard debugger for the GNU software system.
IDE support: Visual Studio (on Windows), Code::Blocks, and CLion provide integrated debugging.
Valgrind: A tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.
Static analyzers: Tools like Clang Static Analyzer can catch potential bugs before runtime.


C++:

GDB: Also the primary debugger for C++.
IDE integration: Visual Studio, CLion, and Qt Creator offer robust debugging features.
Valgrind: Useful for memory-related issues in C++ programs.
Core dump analysis: For post-mortem debugging of crashed programs.
boost::stacktrace: For generating and inspecting backtraces.


Python:

PDB (Python Debugger): The standard library module for debugging.
IDE support: PyCharm, VS Code, and IDLE provide integrated debugging experiences.
logging module: Built-in module for flexible logging.
ipdb: An enhanced interactive debugger with IPython features.
Remote debugging: Supported by many IDEs and frameworks like Flask.



Additional cross-language debugging tools and techniques:

Print debugging: Simple but effective across all languages.
Assertions: Used in all these languages to catch logical errors.
Profilers: Each language has profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
Continuous Integration (CI) tools: Often incorporate automated testing and debugging processes.
