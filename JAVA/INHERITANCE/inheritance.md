Yes, Java provides support for inheritance, which is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). Inheritance allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit fields and methods from another class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the superclass and subclass.

### Key Points about Inheritance in Java:
1. **`extends` Keyword**: 
   - In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword.
   - A subclass inherits the non-private fields and methods of the superclass.

   ```java
   class Animal { // Superclass
       void eat() {
           System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal { // Subclass
       void bark() {
           System.out.println("The dog barks.");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Dog myDog = new Dog();
           myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
           myDog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Single Inheritance**:
   - Java supports single inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from only one superclass.
   - However, a class can have multiple subclasses.

3. **Multilevel Inheritance**:
   - A subclass can also act as a superclass for another class, creating a chain of inheritance.

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void eat() {
           System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void bark() {
           System.out.println("The dog barks.");
       }
   }

   class Puppy extends Dog {
       void weep() {
           System.out.println("The puppy weeps.");
       }
   }
   ```

4. **`super` Keyword**:
   - The `super` keyword is used to refer to the superclass's methods or constructors.
   - It is often used to call the superclass constructor from the subclass.

   ```java
   class Animal {
       Animal() {
           System.out.println("Animal constructor");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       Dog() {
           super(); // Calls the Animal constructor
           System.out.println("Dog constructor");
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Method Overriding**:
   - A subclass can override a method from its superclass to provide a specific implementation.

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       @Override
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }
   ```

6. **No Multiple Inheritance**:
   - Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes (a class cannot extend more than one class).
   - However, multiple inheritance can be achieved using interfaces.

   ```java
   interface A {
       void methodA();
   }

   interface B {
       void methodB();
   }

   class C implements A, B {
       public void methodA() {
           System.out.println("Method A");
       }

       public void methodB() {
           System.out.println("Method B");
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Private members of a superclass are not accessible in the subclass.
   - Protected and public members are accessible.

### Summary:
Java provides robust support for inheritance, allowing classes to reuse and extend functionality from other classes. While it supports single and multilevel inheritance, it avoids the complexity of multiple inheritance with classes by using interfaces instead.
