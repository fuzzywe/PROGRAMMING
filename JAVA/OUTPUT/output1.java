Dry Run:
Initialization:
i is declared but not initialized in the outer scope.
The loop starts with i = 1.

Loop Iterations:

1st iteration (i = 1):

i > 3 is false, so it doesn't execute continue.
The loop proceeds normally to i++, so i becomes 2.
2nd iteration (i = 2):

i > 3 is false again, so the loop proceeds and i is incremented to 3.
3rd iteration (i = 3):

i > 3 is still false, so the loop continues, and i becomes 4.
4th iteration (i = 4):

Now, i > 3 is true, so continue is executed. This skips the rest of the loop for this iteration, but i++ still happens afterward.
i becomes 5.
5th iteration (i = 5):

i > 3 is true again, so the loop skips the rest with continue.
i is incremented to 6.
End of Loop:

The loop terminates when i = 6 because the condition i < 6 is false.
Final Output: After the loop ends, the System.out.println(i); statement prints the value of i, which is 6.

Output:
Copy code
6
This is the value of i after the for loop finishes executing.
