The code has a **compilation error** due to the use of the wrong method for printing multiple variables in Java. Here's an explanation of **why** and **how** to fix it:

---

### **Why the Error Occurs**
1. **Incorrect Use of `System.out.println()`**:  
   - `System.out.println()` can only take **one argument** in Java. You attempted to pass `xy.x` and `xy.y` as **two separate arguments**, which is invalid.

2. **Correct Syntax**:  
   - You must concatenate or format the variables into a single string.

---

### **Fixing the Error**
#### **Option 1: Concatenation**
```java
System.out.println("x = " + xy.x + ", y = " + xy.y);
```
This combines `"x = "` with `xy.x` and `", y = "` with `xy.y` into a single string.

#### **Option 2: Using `printf` for Formatting**
```java
System.out.printf("x = %d, y = %d%n", xy.x, xy.y);
```
`%d` formats `int` values, and `%n` adds a newline.

---

### **Why Java Requires This**
Unlike some languages like Python, which allow multiple arguments in a `print` statement, Javaâ€™s `System.out.println` method only accepts a **single argument**. It can be a string, an object, or another compatible type, but **separate values must be combined**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The error occurs because `System.out.println(xy.x, xy.y)` passes two arguments, which is not allowed. Use string concatenation or formatting to print both variables correctly.
