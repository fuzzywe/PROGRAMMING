In Java, Runnable is an interface that represents a task or a unit of work that can be executed concurrently, typically by a thread. It is part of the java.lang package and is used when you want to define a task that can be executed by a thread but do not need to extend the Thread class.

The Runnable interface has only one method:

java
Copy code
public void run();
Key Points:
The Runnable interface is designed to provide a standard way to define a task for execution by a thread.
It is often used in multi-threading to separate the task definition from the actual thread execution.

  
Advantages of Using Runnable:
Flexibility: The Runnable interface allows you to create a thread without extending the Thread class, giving you flexibility to extend other classes if needed.
Code Reusability: Since Runnable separates the task from the thread, the same task can be used by multiple threads.
When to Use Runnable:
Use Runnable when you want to execute tasks concurrently without needing to extend the Thread class.
It is preferred when your class already extends another class, as Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance.
