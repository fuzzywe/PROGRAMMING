What is the purpose of the assert keyword in Java?

The 'assert' keyword is like a guard that checks if something is true during testing. It makes sure your program is working correctly by checking conditions you expect to be true. If the condition is false, it raises an alarm (error). It's like having a friend double-check your math homework - they'll let you know if something doesn't add up.
