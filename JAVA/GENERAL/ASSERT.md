What is the purpose of the assert keyword in Java?

The 'assert' keyword is like a guard that checks if something is true during testing. It makes sure your program is working correctly by 

checking conditions you expect to be true. If the condition is false, it raises an alarm (error). It's like having a friend double-check your 

math homework - they'll let you know if something doesn't add up. 

SOC (Separation of Concerns) is like organizing a backpack for school. Just as you keep your books, lunch, and gym clothes in different 

sections of your backpack, SOC means keeping different parts of your program separate based on what they do. Each part handles its own job 

without messing with the others. This makes your code easier to fix, change, and understand - just like finding things in an organized backpack


What is the Separation of Concerns principle in software engineering?

Combining all functionalities into a single module

Dividing a program into distinct sections, each handling a specific aspect(correct)

Ensuring all code is written in one programming language

Ignoring modular design for faster development

Explanation

The Separation of Concerns principle is like organizing your room. Instead of tossing everything in one big pile, you put clothes in the 

closet, books on the shelf, and toys in a box. In coding, it means splitting your program into parts that each do one main job. This makes 

your code easier to understand, fix, and change. It's like having a neat, organized room where you can find and fix things quickly.
