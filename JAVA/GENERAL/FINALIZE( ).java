The finalize() method in Java is called before an object is garbage collected to allow that object to perform any necessary cleanup tasks before it is permanently removed from memory.

When an object becomes unreachable (i.e., there are no references to it), the garbage collector identifies it for collection.
Before permanently removing the object from memory, the garbage collector calls the finalize() method of that object (if it has been overridden).
After the finalize() method has executed, the garbage collector can then reclaim the memory associated with the object.
