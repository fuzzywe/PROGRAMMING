A deep copy is like making a perfect clone of a toy box and all the toys inside. You don't just copy the box, you also make new copies of every toy. In Java terms, this means creating a new object and new copies of all the objects it contains or refers to. It's thorough but can take more time and memory. This is useful when you need a completely independent copy with no shared parts.
