What is the default value of a local variable in Java?

null
It has no default value
false
Explanation
Local variables in Java are like empty boxes that you have to fill yourself. Unlike class variables, Java doesn't automatically put anything in these boxes for you. If you try to use a local variable without giving it a value first, the computer will complain. It's like trying to give someone the contents of an empty box â€“ there's nothing there! This rule helps catch mistakes where you might forget to set important values in your code.
