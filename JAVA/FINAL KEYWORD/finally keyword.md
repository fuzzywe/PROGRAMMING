Explanation
The 'finally' block is like a cleanup crew. It always shows up to do its job, no matter what happens in the try-catch part. Think of it as the last stop on a roller coaster - you'll get there whether the ride was smooth or bumpy. It's great for tasks you want done no matter what, like closing files or disconnecting from databases. This way, you can be sure important cleanup happens even if things go wrong.
