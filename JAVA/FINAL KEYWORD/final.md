Explanation
The 'final' keyword in Java is like putting a lock on something. When you use it on a variable, you're saying, "This value is set in stone!" Once you give a final variable a value, it can't be changed. It's like writing in permanent marker instead of pencil. This is super useful when you have important numbers or values that should never change in your program, keeping things safe and predictable
