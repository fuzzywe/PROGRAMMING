In programming, the stack and heap are two distinct areas of memory used for different purposes. Here's a breakdown of what each of these memory areas stores:

Stack Memory
Storage Type:

Local Variables: Variables defined within a function or a method are stored on the stack. These variables are automatically allocated when the function is called and deallocated when the function exits.
Function Parameters: Parameters passed to functions/methods are also stored on the stack.
Return Addresses: The address of the next instruction to execute after a function call is stored in the stack, allowing the program to return to the correct location after the function execution.
Memory Management:

Automatic: Memory allocation and deallocation for stack variables are handled automatically by the system as functions are called and return.
Last In, First Out (LIFO): The stack follows a LIFO structure, meaning the last item added is the first one to be removed.
Lifetime: The lifetime of stack variables is tied to the function's execution. Once the function exits, the memory is freed.

Size Limit: Stack size is usually limited and can lead to stack overflow errors if too much memory is used (e.g., due to deep recursion).

Heap Memory
Storage Type:

Dynamic Variables: Memory for variables allocated at runtime using commands like new (C++/Java), malloc() (C), or alloc() (Python) is stored on the heap.
Objects: In object-oriented languages, objects created dynamically are stored in the heap.
Memory Management:

Manual: Memory allocation and deallocation in the heap need to be managed manually by the programmer. In languages with garbage collection (like Java or Python), the runtime environment will reclaim memory no longer in use.
Flexible Size: The heap can grow and shrink dynamically, allowing for larger memory allocations compared to the stack.
Lifetime: The lifetime of heap variables is not tied to function execution. They persist until they are explicitly deallocated (or collected by a garbage collector).

Fragmentation: Over time, as memory is allocated and freed, the heap can become fragmented, leading to inefficient memory usage.

Summary Table
Feature	Stack	Heap
Storage	Local variables, parameters, return addresses	Dynamic variables, objects
Memory Management	Automatic, LIFO	Manual, dynamic size
Lifetime	Tied to function execution	Persistent until deallocated
Size Limit	Limited, can cause stack overflow	Larger, can lead to fragmentation
Access Speed	Faster due to contiguous memory	Slower due to fragmentation
Example Illustration
Stack Example (C/C++/Java):

java
Copy code
void exampleFunction() {
    int a = 10;  // Stored in stack
    int b = 20;  // Stored in stack
    int sum = a + b;  // sum stored in stack
}
Heap Example (C/C++/Java):

java
Copy code
void exampleFunction() {
    int* ptr = new int; // Allocated in heap
    *ptr = 10; // Using heap memory
    delete ptr; // Deallocated memory
}
Understanding the differences between stack and heap memory is crucial for efficient memory management and avoiding common programming issues such as memory leaks and stack overflows.
