Here are detailed and unique examples for each of the requested C++ concepts:

---

### **31. What is operator overloading?**

Operator overloading allows custom implementation of operators for user-defined types (classes) to work intuitively with them.

#### **Unique Example:**
Let's overload the `[]` operator to access elements in a class that represents a **matrix**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Matrix {
private:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> mat;
public:
    Matrix(int rows, int cols) {
        mat.resize(rows, std::vector<int>(cols, 0));
    }

    std::vector<int>& operator[](int index) {
        return mat[index];
    }

    void print() {
        for (auto& row : mat) {
            for (auto& elem : row) {
                std::cout << elem << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Matrix m(3, 3);
    m[0][1] = 5;  // Using overloaded [] operator
    m.print();
}
```

### **32. Explain function overloading in C++**

Function overloading in C++ allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types or counts.

#### **Unique Example:**
We overload a function `compute` to handle both **strings** and **integers**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Processor {
public:
    void compute(int num) {
        std::cout << "Integer computation: " << num * 2 << std::endl;
    }

    void compute(std::string str) {
        std::cout << "String computation: " << str + " processed" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Processor p;
    p.compute(10);       // Calls the integer version
    p.compute("hello");  // Calls the string version
}
```

### **33. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?**

- **Shallow copy**: Copies the object reference (pointer) but not the actual data.
- **Deep copy**: Copies both the object and the data it points to, creating a new independent copy.

#### **Unique Example:**
We will demonstrate deep copy with a class that owns dynamically allocated memory.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class DeepCopy {
private:
    int* data;
public:
    DeepCopy(int val) : data(new int(val)) {}
    
    // Deep copy constructor
    DeepCopy(const DeepCopy& other) : data(new int(*other.data)) {}

    ~DeepCopy() {
        delete data;
    }

    void print() { std::cout << *data << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    DeepCopy obj1(100);
    DeepCopy obj2 = obj1;  // Deep copy happens here

    obj2.print();  // 100
    obj1.print();  // 100
}
```

### **34. What is the Rule of Three/Five in C++?**

The Rule of Three/Five states that if a class requires a user-defined destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator, it likely also requires all three. In C++11, the Rule of Five extends this to include the move constructor and move assignment operator.

#### **Unique Example:**
Let’s implement Rule of Five with a class owning dynamic memory.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

class RuleOfFive {
private:
    char* data;
public:
    RuleOfFive(const char* val) {
        data = new char[strlen(val) + 1];
        strcpy(data, val);
    }

    // Copy constructor
    RuleOfFive(const RuleOfFive& other) {
        data = new char[strlen(other.data) + 1];
        strcpy(data, other.data);
    }

    // Move constructor
    RuleOfFive(RuleOfFive&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr;
    }

    // Copy assignment
    RuleOfFive& operator=(const RuleOfFive& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            data = new char[strlen(other.data) + 1];
            strcpy(data, other.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move assignment
    RuleOfFive& operator=(RuleOfFive&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data;
            data = other.data;
            other.data = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~RuleOfFive() {
        delete[] data;
    }

    void print() { std::cout << data << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    RuleOfFive obj1("Hello");
    RuleOfFive obj2 = obj1;  // Calls copy constructor
    RuleOfFive obj3 = std::move(obj1);  // Calls move constructor

    obj3.print();
}
```

### **35. What is the purpose of the explicit keyword?**

The `explicit` keyword prevents implicit conversions for constructors and conversion operators.

#### **Unique Example:**
We demonstrate `explicit` by disallowing implicit conversion in a constructor.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Temperature {
private:
    int temp;
public:
    explicit Temperature(int t) : temp(t) {}

    void display() { std::cout << "Temperature: " << temp << "°C" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Temperature t1 = 30;  // Error: Cannot convert implicitly because of `explicit`
    Temperature t2(30);    // Works fine
    t2.display();
}
```

### **36. Explain the concept of move semantics.**

Move semantics allow transferring ownership of resources (like memory) instead of copying them, improving performance, especially for temporary objects.

#### **Unique Example:**
We will move resources in a class and optimize memory management using move semantics.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class LargeObject {
private:
    std::vector<int> data;
public:
    LargeObject() {
        data.resize(1000, 1);
    }

    // Move constructor
    LargeObject(LargeObject&& other) noexcept : data(std::move(other.data)) {
        std::cout << "Move constructor" << std::endl;
    }

    void print() {
        std::cout << "Data size: " << data.size() << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    LargeObject obj1;
    LargeObject obj2 = std::move(obj1);  // Move constructor used
    obj2.print();
}
```

### **37. What is the difference between `std::vector` and `std::array`?**

`std::vector` is a dynamic array, whereas `std::array` is a fixed-size array.

#### **Unique Example:**
Let’s compare `std::vector` and `std::array` with an algorithmic use case.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::array<int, 5> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Fixed size, compile-time size
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};   // Dynamic size, can grow/shrink

    // Add an element to vector
    vec.push_back(6);

    std::cout << "Array size: " << arr.size() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Vector size: " << vec.size() << std::endl;
}
```

### **38. What are lambda expressions in C++?**

Lambdas are anonymous functions that allow inline definition of functions, simplifying code.

#### **Unique Example:**
We will use lambda expressions for **sorting** and **transformation**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 5, 3, 9, 7};

    // Lambda for sorting
    std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int a, int b) {
        return a > b;  // Sort in descending order
    });

    // Lambda for printing
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [](int num) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    });
}
```

### **39. What is the purpose of the `mutable` keyword?**

The `mutable` keyword allows modifying member variables in `const` member functions.

#### **Unique Example:**
Let’s use `mutable` to modify a member even in a `const` function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Counter {
private:
    mutable int count = 0;
public:
    void increment() const { count++; }

    void display() const { std::cout << "Count: " << count << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    const Counter c;
    c.increment();  // Can modify count because of mutable
    c.display();
}
```

### **40. Explain the concept of template specialization.**

Template specialization allows you to provide custom behavior for specific template arguments.

#### **Unique Example:**
Here we specialize a template for the `std::string` type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

template<typename T>
void print(T val) {
    std::cout << val << std::endl;
}

// Specialization for std::string
template<>
void print<std::string>(std::string val) {
    std::cout << "String value: " << val << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print(42);             // General template
    print("Hello World");  // General template
    print(std::string("Specialized template"));  // Specialized for string
}
```

For the coding question you mentioned (summing elements and printing the number of digits greater than a certain value), I will provide a C++ solution that calculates the sum of the array's digits, finds the average, and compares each element with the average to count how many digits are greater.

For the second part, sorting an array containing 0s, 1s, and 2s, this is a variation of the "Dutch National Flag" problem, which can be solved efficiently using the 3-way partitioning approach.

### **1️⃣ Array-based Problem:**
The task involves summing the array's digits and comparing each digit with the computed average.

Here's a C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {2, 4, 1, 6, 9}; // Example array
    
    // Calculate the sum of the array
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }

    // Calculate the average of the array
    float avg = (float)sum / arr.size();

    // Count elements greater than the average
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] > avg) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    cout << "Sum of elements: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Average of elements: " << avg << endl;
    cout << "Count of elements greater than the average: " << count << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**
1. The program first calculates the sum of the array elements.
2. It then computes the average of the array elements by dividing the sum by the array's size.
3. Finally, it iterates through the array and counts how many elements are greater than the computed average.

### **2️⃣ Sorting an Array Containing 0s, 1s, and 2s:**
This can be solved using the "Dutch National Flag Problem," which can be efficiently implemented in C++ using a three-pointer approach.

Here's the code for sorting an array with 0s, 1s, and 2s:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void sortArray(vector<int>& arr) {
    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (arr[mid] == 0) {
            swap(arr[low], arr[mid]);
            low++;
            mid++;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
            mid++;
        }
        else {
            swap(arr[mid], arr[high]);
            high--;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2}; // Example array

    sortArray(arr);

    cout << "Sorted Array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**
1. We use three pointers (`low`, `mid`, `high`) to partition the array into three sections: 0s, 1s, and 2s.
2. The `mid` pointer traverses through the array, and based on the element at `arr[mid]`, we move elements to the appropriate positions using `low` and `high`.
3. If `arr[mid] == 0`, we swap it with `arr[low]` and increment both `low` and `mid`.
4. If `arr[mid] == 1`, we simply move `mid` forward.
5. If `arr[mid] == 2`, we swap it with `arr[high]` and decrement `high`.

Both problems are solved with efficient algorithms in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for these tasks.

Certainly! Here are answers for the remaining sections based on your interview experience:
