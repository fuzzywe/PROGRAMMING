I'll provide a comprehensive set of interview questions covering inheritance in Java, ranging from basic to advanced levels:

Beginner Level:
1. What is inheritance in Java, and why is it important?
2. How do you create a subclass in Java?
3. What does the `extends` keyword do in Java?
4. Can a class in Java inherit from multiple classes? Why or why not?
5. What is the difference between a superclass and a subclass?

Intermediate Level:
6. Explain the purpose of the `super` keyword in Java. Give two different use cases.
7. What happens if you don't call `super()` in a subclass constructor?
8. How does inheritance affect access to private members of a superclass?
9. What is the significance of the line `SUPERCLASS ref = new SUBCLASS();`?
10. Can you explain how constructor chaining works in inheritance?

Advanced Level:
11. What are the implications of using the `final` keyword with classes and methods?
12. How does the compiler handle method calls in inherited classes?
13. Explain the concept of early binding vs. late binding in the context of inheritance.
14. Why can't a class be both `abstract` and `final`?
15. How do static methods behave differently in inheritance compared to instance methods?

Complex Scenario Questions:
16. Write a scenario demonstrating how `super()` is used to call a superclass constructor with parameters.
17. Explain the nuances of method overriding and how it relates to polymorphism.
18. Describe a situation where using `final` with a method or class would be beneficial.

Tricky Questions:
19. Why does polymorphism not apply to instance variables?
20. If a subclass defines a variable with the same name as a variable in its superclass, what happens?

Conceptual Deep Dive:
21. Compare and contrast inheritance with composition. When would you prefer one over the other?
22. How does inheritance support the principle of code reusability in object-oriented programming?

Error and Edge Case Analysis:
23. What compilation errors might occur when implementing inheritance incorrectly?
24. How does Java prevent a class from becoming its own superclass?

Performance and Design Questions:
25. Explain how `final` methods can potentially improve performance.
26. What are the design considerations when deciding to make a method or class `final`?

Practical Implementation:
27. Create a small example demonstrating a multilevel inheritance hierarchy.
28. Show how you would use `super` to access a superclass method that has been overridden in a subclass.

Debugging and Reasoning:
29. Debug this code: What will be printed and why?
```java
class Parent {
    int x = 10;
    void print() {
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    int x = 20;
    void print() {
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```

Reflection and Best Practices:
30. What are some best practices to follow when designing inheritance hierarchies?

These questions cover a wide range of aspects related to inheritance in Java, testing not just memorization but deep understanding of the concept. They challenge candidates to demonstrate both theoretical knowledge and practical application of inheritance principles.

Recommended approach for interviewers:
- Start with basic questions to build candidate confidence
- Progressively move to more complex scenarios
- Look for clear explanations, not just correct answers
- Observe how candidates reason through inheritance challenges
- Pay attention to their understanding of object-oriented design principles
