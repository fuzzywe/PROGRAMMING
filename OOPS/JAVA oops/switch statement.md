Question 1: What is a switch statement in Java, and how is it used?

Answer: A switch statement in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to execute one block of code among many options based on the value of a variable. It is used to make the code more readable and easier to maintain compared to multiple if-else statements. The switch statement evaluates an expression and matches it against multiple case values. The corresponding block of code is executed for the matching case.

Question 2: What are the key components of a switch statement?

Answer: The key components of a switch statement are:

Expression: The variable or expression to be evaluated.
Case: Each case label specifies a value to be compared with the expression.
Break: The break statement is used to terminate a case and prevent fall-through.
Default: The default case is optional and is executed if the expression does not match any case values.
Question 3: Why is the break statement important in a switch statement?

Answer: The break statement is important in a switch statement because it terminates the execution of the current case and prevents fall-through to the next case. Without break, the control will continue to execute the subsequent cases, which is usually not desired. Using break ensures that only the matching case block is executed.
