# Object-Oriented Programming Interview Questions & Answers

## Basic OOP Concepts

### 1. What is Object-oriented programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (methods). OOP emphasizes organizing software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

### 2. What are the main features of object-oriented programming?
The four main features of OOP are:
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), restricting direct access to some object's components.
2. **Inheritance**: Mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
3. **Polymorphism**: Ability of objects to take on multiple forms and behave differently based on the context.
4. **Abstraction**: Process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

### 3. What are the advantages of Object-oriented programming?
- **Reusability**: Code can be reused through inheritance
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and modify existing code
- **Security**: Through encapsulation and abstraction
- **Modularity**: Programs can be divided into small, independent objects
- **Flexibility**: Through polymorphism and dynamic binding
- **Better problem-solving model**: Maps naturally to real-world problems

## Classes and Objects

### 4. What is Structural programming?
Structural programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes a clear control flow and structured control constructs. It focuses on functions/procedures rather than objects and typically follows a top-down approach.

### 5. What is a class?
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that its objects will have. Think of it as a custom data type that encapsulates data and behavior.

### 6. What is an object?
An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created using the class blueprint that contains real data and can perform actions defined by its class methods.

### 7. Is it always necessary to create objects from class?
No, not always. Static classes and utility classes might never need instantiation. Abstract classes also can't be instantiated directly.

## Constructors and Destructors

### 8. What is a constructor?
A constructor is a special method that initializes a new object. It's called automatically when an object is created and sets up the initial state of the object.

### 9. Types of constructors:
- **Default constructor**: Takes no parameters
- **Parameterized constructor**: Takes parameters
- **Copy constructor**: Creates an object by copying another object
- **Static constructor**: Initializes static members

### 10. What is a destructor?
A destructor is a special method called when an object is destroyed or deleted. It's used to clean up resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime.

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

### 11. What is a copy constructor?
A copy constructor creates a new object as a copy of an existing object. It's used to create a duplicate object with the same values as another object.

### 12. Difference between class and structure:
- Classes have private access by default; structures have public
- Classes support inheritance; basic structures don't
- Classes are reference types; structures are value types
- Classes can have destructors; structures cannot

### 13. Inheritance concept with example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"
```

### 14. Limitations of inheritance:
- Tight coupling between parent and child classes
- Can lead to complex hierarchies
- Changes in parent class can affect all child classes
- Multiple inheritance can lead to diamond problem

### 15. Types of inheritance:
- **Single inheritance**: One class inherits from one base class
- **Multiple inheritance**: One class inherits from multiple base classes
- **Multilevel inheritance**: Class inherits from a derived class
- **Hierarchical inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from one base class
- **Hybrid inheritance**: Combination of multiple inheritance types

## Advanced OOP Concepts

### 16. Hierarchical inheritance:
When multiple classes inherit from a single base class, forming a hierarchy. Example: Animal → {Dog, Cat, Bird}

### 17. Multiple vs. Multi-level inheritance:
- **Multiple**: Class inherits from multiple base classes
- **Multi-level**: Chain of inheritance (A → B → C)

### 18. Hybrid inheritance:
Combination of two or more types of inheritance. For example, combining multiple and single inheritance.

### 19. What is a subclass?
A subclass (derived class) is a class that inherits properties and methods from another class.

### 20. What is a superclass?
A superclass (base class) is the class being inherited from by another class.

### 21. What is an interface?
An interface is a contract that specifies what methods a class must implement. It defines a set of abstract methods that implementing classes must provide.

## Polymorphism Details

### 22. What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows objects to behave differently based on context. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

### 23. Static polymorphism:
Compile-time polymorphism achieved through method overloading.

### 24. Dynamic polymorphism:
Runtime polymorphism achieved through method overriding.

### 25. Method overloading:
Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.

### 26. Method overriding:
Redefining a method in a derived class that was already defined in the base class.

### 27. Operator overloading:
Giving new meanings to operators when applied to user-defined types.

## Encapsulation and Abstraction

### 28. Overloading vs. Overriding:
- **Overloading**: Same method name, different parameters, in same class
- **Overriding**: Same method signature, different implementation, in derived class

### 29. Encapsulation:
Bundling of data with methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some object's components.

### 30. Data abstraction:
Hiding complex implementation details and showing only necessary features of an object.

### 31. How to accomplish data abstraction:
- Through abstract classes
- Through interfaces
- Using access modifiers
- Implementation hiding

### 32. Abstract class:
A class that can't be instantiated and may contain abstract methods. It's meant to be inherited by concrete classes.

## Access Control and Virtual Functions

### 33. Access specifiers:
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **Private**: Accessible only within the class
- **Protected**: Accessible within class and its subclasses

### 34. Creating instance of abstract class:
You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly. You must inherit from it and implement its abstract methods.

### 35. Virtual function:
A method that can be redefined in derived classes, enabling runtime polymorphism.

### 36. Pure virtual function:
A virtual function that must be implemented by derived classes. Declared with "= 0" in C++.

## Exception Handling and Memory Management

### 37. Data abstraction vs. encapsulation:
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity, showing only necessary features
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods, controlling access

### 38. Interfaces vs. abstract classes:
- **Interfaces**: Only abstract methods, multiple inheritance possible
- **Abstract classes**: Can have implementation, single inheritance only

### 39. Final variable:
A variable whose value cannot be changed after initialization.

### 40. Exception:
An unexpected event that occurs during program execution, disrupting normal flow.

### 41. Exception handling:
Mechanism to handle runtime errors to maintain normal program flow.

### 42. Error vs. exception:
- **Error**: Serious problem that program shouldn't try to catch
- **Exception**: Condition that program might want to catch

### 43. Try-catch block:
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

### 44. Finally block:
Block of code that always executes, whether exception occurs or not.

### 45. Finalize method:
Method called by garbage collector before object destruction.

### 46. Garbage Collection:
Automatic memory management process that removes unused objects.

    - An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

41. **Define exception handling**
    - Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

42. **Is an error the same as an exception?**
    - No, an error is a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch, while an exception is a condition that a reasonable application might want to catch.

43. **What is a try-catch block?**
    - A try-catch block is used to handle exceptions. The `try` block contains code that may throw an exception, and the `catch` block contains code that handles the exception.
