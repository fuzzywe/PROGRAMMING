### Sample Questions and Answers

#### 1. What is a package in Java, and why do we use it?

- **Answer**: 
  Packages in Java are a way to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces, similar to folders on a computer. They help avoid naming conflicts and allow better modularization of code. By using packages, code is more organized, secure, and can be accessed according to different access levels.

#### 2. How do you create a package in Java?

- **Answer**: 
  To create a package, use the `package` keyword at the top of your Java file. For example:
  ```java
  package com.example.myapp;
  public class MyClass {
      // Class code here
  }
  ```
  Here, `com.example.myapp` is the package name, and all classes within this file will belong to this package.

#### 3. What is the `static` keyword in Java?

- **Answer**: 
  The `static` keyword in Java is used for memory management. When a member is declared static, it belongs to the class itself rather than any instance of the class. This means that static members are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed without creating an instance.

#### 4. Give an example of using the `static` keyword.

- **Answer**: 
  Here’s a simple example:
  ```java
  public class MyClass {
      static int count = 0;
      MyClass() {
          count++;
      }
      public static void displayCount() {
          System.out.println("Count: " + count);
      }
  }
  ```
  Since `count` is static, it will keep a single count across all instances of `MyClass`.

#### 5. What is a Singleton class in Java?

- **Answer**: 
  A Singleton class is a design pattern in which only one instance of the class can exist. This pattern is often used in logging, database connections, and other applications where a single shared resource is sufficient.

#### 6. How would you implement a Singleton class in Java?

- **Answer**:
  Here’s a simple way to implement a Singleton:
  ```java
  public class Singleton {
      private static Singleton instance;
      private Singleton() {}
      
      public static Singleton getInstance() {
          if (instance == null) {
              instance = new Singleton();
          }
          return instance;
      }
  }
  ```
  This code ensures that only one instance of `Singleton` can exist.

#### 7. Explain the purpose of in-built methods in Java.

- **Answer**: 
  Java offers in-built methods across various libraries (like `java.lang`, `java.util`) to perform common operations, such as manipulating strings, handling collections, and performing mathematical calculations. These methods simplify development as they eliminate the need to write complex code for standard tasks.

#### 8. Give an example of a useful in-built method in Java.

- **Answer**: 
  A useful in-built method is `String`'s `.toUpperCase()` method:
  ```java
  String text = "hello";
  System.out.println(text.toUpperCase()); // Outputs: HELLO
  ```
  This method converts the entire string to uppercase, providing an easy way to change text case without additional code.

#### 9. Can you explain the difference between `static` and `non-static` methods?

- **Answer**:
  - **Static methods** belong to the class and can be called without creating an object. They can access only other static members.
  - **Non-static methods** belong to instances of the class and can access both static and non-static members. You need an object of the class to invoke non-static methods.

#### 10. What is the difference between `import` and `package`?

- **Answer**: 
  - **Package**: Used to group related classes and avoid naming conflicts.
  - **Import**: Used to bring specific classes or entire packages into visibility, so you don’t need to specify the package each time.

#### 11. How do you access a class from a different package?

- **Answer**: 
  To access a class from a different package, you first import the package:
  ```java
  import com.example.myapp.MyClass;
  ```
  Then, you can use `MyClass` directly in your code.

#### 12. Why is the Singleton pattern important in Java?

- **Answer**: 
  The Singleton pattern is important because it provides a controlled way of creating a single instance of a class. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances would lead to resource conflicts or excessive memory use, such as in database connections or log file management.
